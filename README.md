## Description:
Rotten Reality is a Zelda Dungeon style puzzle game where the player must solve a set of traversal based puzzles using a set of abilities they can control. Unlike many puzzle games on the market, however, the player starts the game with all the abilities already in their arsenal. The abilities allow the player to control aspects of gravity, space, and perception. The gravity ability allows the player to control which way they and other objects fall. The space ability allows the player to control how large or small they and other objects are. The perception ability allows the player to see objects that otherwise would be invisible to them.
As players progress through the game by solving puzzles using the aforementioned abilities, they will be required to lose those abilities. Therefore, as they continue to play, their solutions to the new puzzles they face and old puzzles they revisit will need to be more creative given their more limited toolset of abilities.

## Controls:
- `A`, `S`, `D`, and `W` to move player.
- Mouse to rotate camera around player.
- `E` to activate the current ability.
- `R` to rotate/toggle to the next ability.
- `Space Bar` to jump.
